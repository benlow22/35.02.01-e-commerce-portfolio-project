1. Set up an Express server
        - Create a directory for your project and set up a basic Express server.

    a) Make directory for project 

        ### terminal
        >>> cd            = into desired location (/Users/benjaminlow/Compsci/.../.../Projects)
            >>> mkdir 35.02.01 project     = make directory 

    b) Set up files in Directory 
        ### 35.02.01 project
        >>> touch app.js        = create a new file "app.js"
        >>> npm init            = create package.json file 
            - follow prompts, press 'ENTER' for default 
            - entry point = app.js 
        >>> npm install express = install express to dependencies 

    c) Start Express server in app.js file 
        >>> code .              = open vsc for directory 
                                - if not working = in VSC command line >shell command install CODE in PATH

        ### app.js
        >>> const express = require('express')      = import express module
            const app = express()                   = create instance of express application = can use methods (get, listen, put, ...) from express
            const port = 3000                       = store port number = endpoint communication

            app.get('/', (req, res) => {            = create get method at endpoint localhost:port3000/
                res.send('Hello World!')            = respond with 'Hello World!'
            })

            app.listen(port, () => {                = starts server, listening on port (3000), success = log
                console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
            })


2. Set up version control
    - Set up Git tracking in your directory and make sure to add and commit changes as you make them.

    a) init git repository in directory 
        ###terminal 
        >>> git init            = initialize git repository

        !!! on vsc bottom right should say 'master*' branch 
            U   = untracked file
            A   = added to stage area
            M   = Modified (An existing file has been changed)
            D   = Deleted (a file has been deleted)
            C   = Conflict (There is a conflict in the file)
            R   = Renamed (The file has been renamed)
            S   = Submodule (In repository exists another subrepository)
            green gutter    = new line
            blue gutter     = changes line
            red triangle    = deleted line 
            git reset --hard 11c87b92cf    
            
            if you add to staging area and re-edit, must unstage and restage to save

    b) commit all to main branch to start   
        ### VSC 
        >>> 'Source Control' tab        = control + shift + G  
            >>> '+'                     = add all/files to staging area
            >>> _message_               = enter commit message 
                >>> 'Commit'            = commit starting changes

        >>> 'Open Changes' (top right)  = view changes to file
        >>> 'Inline view'               = all in one doc before you commit

    c) PUBLISH git to github 
        1. >>> 'Source Control' > 'Publish Git' (after you commited) = takes you to github
        2. ### Github 
            >>> 'New repository' (fill out) > 'Create repository' > 
                >>> git remote add origin https://github.com/benlow22/_git_repo_name_.git
                    git branch -M main
                    git push -u origin main

    d) Push to github
        After commiting     >>> 'Source Control' > 'Publish Git' > 'Sync' > 'Push ...'

    e) Create a new branch to work on 
        ###VSC 
        >>> cmd + shift + p     = preferences 
            >>> 'Git: Create Branch..."         = creates a new branch and moves you to it. 
                "branch name"

    f) move branch
        >>> "branch name" (bottom left corner)
            - commits must be made first

    g) merge branch
        ### main-branch (master-branch)             = move to the branch you want to merge things on to 
        >>> "..." > "Branch" > "Merge Branch..."


Design the database
Plan out the different types of data the application will track and how those pieces of data relate.

Create PostgreSQL database and tables
Create a PostgreSQL database and add the tables from your design.

Connect the app and database
Set up your application to be able to interface with the PostgreSQL database.

Plan API endpoints
Plan the API endpoints that will be used in retrieving data from your database.

Set up user registration
Add the logic for handling registration of new users.

Set up local login
Add the logic for handling login using a username and password.

Set up product endpoints
Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to products.

Set up user endpoints
Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to users and their accounts

Set up cart endpoint
Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to a user’s cart.

Set up checkout endpoint
Add the logic for handling checkout. There is no need to actually try and charge somebody yet; charging will come in a later evolution of this project. For now, we will assume that all charges succeed for ease of development (still add in error handling to account for times it doesn’t).

Set up order endpoints
Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to orders.

Document the API
Document the API you have built by adding and configuring Swagger to your project.

Next Steps
You’re welcome to expand your API beyond these project tasks and get creative! A future portfolio project will build on top of what you have built here, covering tasks for creating the client side of your e-commerce application. If you don’t want to wait that long, you can try building out a client for your API on your own!
